# calsync

This is an internal tool to one-way sync ICS calendars to Obsidian files. I wrote this by hand in around 2 hours at 05:30 one morning. It's pretty simple to use but I'm not going to document it because there's no reason to. But the gist is that you can run this on cron to stream events from sources like Google Calendar to some output directory's Markdown files, within some delimiters.
